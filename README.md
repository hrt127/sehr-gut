# sehr-gut
## florida ze germans r cumming

Wanna have fun with friends/weirdoes and chatting to them.  
It’s a me‑chat translate/enhance thing. Basic, silly, but growing into something useful.

---

##  Overview
This project is an evolving experiment in chat translation + enhancement + not being a circlejerked
None of the existing templates/tools fit what I wanted, so this is my own take, expect nothing but a stupid trying in full view of an adoring public. 

---

##  Getting Started
Clone the repo and jump into whichever version/step feels right:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/sehr-gut.git
cd sehr-gut
```

## Log/Process (optional but fun fml cooked)

- Vercel app from index html file

## Roadmap
- Getting the initial thing done with claude as something usable other than in the browse as an artifact. Which is gh repo html and importing into vercell
- Understanding myself and what I want and what it can encompass plus tools ever changing and how I'd actually find it useful to me. Make available to others interested in schizo
