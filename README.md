## florida ze germans r cumming

Wanna have fun meaningful with friends/weirdoes and chatting to them.  
I'm frequently accredited with speaking schizo - let's super sayan nicer schizo goes abroad. It’s a me‑chat translate/enhance thing. Basic, silly, but growing into something useful.

## 📊 Project Status
Current stage: **Usable (try with caution)**  

- ✅ Core prototype deployed (HTML + Vercel)  
- 🍌 Streamlit app with tabs (Decode, Comebacks, Log) — works but needs refinement  
- 🍌 Expanding slang DB + personalization — partially explored, not stable yet  
- 🍌 Preparing platform integrations (Discord, Farcaster, etc.) — ideas in motion, not ready  
- ‼️ Expect bugs and ongoing iteration as I learn and adjust

## 🌱 Overview
**sehr-gut** is a contextual banter assistant — not just a translator.  
It decodes slang, memes, and layered meaning in online conversations, then suggests playful comebacks with different spice levels.  

Think henlo for the shcizo let's get on base 2:  
- **Not** “How do I say hello?” 
- **But** “They just said *Ehrenmann* — are they roasting me or complimenting me?”
