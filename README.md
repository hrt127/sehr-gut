# sehr-gut
## florida ze germans r cumming

It's me wanna have fun meaningful with friends/weirdoes and chatting to them.
I'm frequently accredited with speaking schizo - let's super sayan nicer schizo goes abroad. It’s a me‑chat translate/enhance thing. Basic, silly, but growing into something useful.

## Project Status
Current stage: **Usable (try with caution)**  
- ✅ First fakeprototype deployed (HTML + Vercel)  

---

## Overview
**sehr-gut** is a contextual banter assistant — not just a translator.  
It decodes slang, memes, and layered meaning in online conversations, then suggests playful comebacks with different spice levels.  

Think henlo for the shcizo let's get on base 2:  
- **Not** “How do I say hello?” 
- **But** “They just said *Ehrenmann* — are they roasting me or complimenting me?”

## 🔄 Current vs Next  

### 🎂 Current Deploy  
- Basic HTML translator only  
- Hosted on Vercel  
- Internal prototype — not ready for visitors  

### 🍌 Next Iteration (coming soon)  
- Streamlit app with tabs (Decode, Comebacks, Log) — works but needs refinement  
- Expanding slang DB + personalization — partially explored, not stable yet  
- Preparing platform integrations (Discord, Farcaster, etc.) — ideas in motion, not ready  
- Expect bugs and ongoing iteration as I learn and adjust  
- Comeback generator with spice levels 🌶️  
- Interaction log to grow style over time  
- Roadmap alignment with README vision
